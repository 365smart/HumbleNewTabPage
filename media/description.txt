This extension replaces the default new tab page with a nicer one.

Your bookmarks, apps, most visited sites, recently closed tabs, and weather forecast are shown in a column. Drag and drop folders to create new columns or reorder them. The font, colors, spacing, and more can be customized from the options menu.
